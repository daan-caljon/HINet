# HINet: Heterogeneous Interference Network
This repository provides the code for the paper *"Estimating treatment effects in networks using domain adversarial learning"*.

```

## Installation.
The ```requirements.txt``` provides the necessary packages.
All code was written for ```python 3.12.3```.

## Usage
Download the data for the BC and Flickr datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CGOKpd7NU-brk9PpiO6nJcVYp3idi97E?usp=sharing). The original Flickr and BC data comes from [this repo](https://github.com/rguo12/network-deconfounder-wsdm20). We use the same data as [Jiang & Sun (2022)](https://github.com/songjiang0909/Causal-Inference-on-Networked-Data).
Put the data in the ```data/semi_synthetic/``` folder. For the homophilous and BA dataset, set the parameter ```homophily``` to ```True``` or ```False```, respectively. 
Now, the results from the paper can be reproduced by setting the ```DIR``` variable to your directory and selecting the right parameters in the ```wandb``` sweep configuration.
